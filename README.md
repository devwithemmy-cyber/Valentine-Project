This is a little interactive page I made to surprise someone special. It asks for their name, reveals a short love letter, and even lets them tap the heart for a hidden message. Perfect for Valentine’s Day or just to show someone you care.

How it works

Open the page in your browser and click Open ❤️. You will be asked who this is for. Type their name and watch the page come alive. The letter will appear, the heart will pulse, and a secret message waits for those who tap it.

Features

An intro screen with animated messages: "Hey", "I made something", "Just for you"

A prompt to personalize the page with a name

A love letter section that reveals each paragraph smoothly as you scroll

A heart that reveals a secret message when clicked

Optional background music that plays when you click Open

Feel free to use this, share it, or customize it. Spread some love. 

If you like, I can also add a short “How to share this” section so anyone opening it will know how to send it to their special person in a really cute way.

Do you want me to do that?
